### Things i have made:

- MoonSnail - A discord bot used in many servers (over 1.5k members and *almost* verified :D).
- The snailcorp.xyz website (not currently up) - A website and dashboard for MoonSnail.
- Phoenix Client - A *very* failed minecraft 1.12.2 pvp utility client.
- Discord Nitro Sniper - For educational purposes… a node js project that will search for and redeem any valid nitro code sent in any server you can acess (can selfbot or not).

### Things i have made:

- [MoonSnail](https://github.com/seasnail8169/MoonSnail) - A discord bot used in many servers (over 1.5k members and *almost* verified :D).
- The [snailcorp](snailcorp.xyz) website (not currently up) - A website for me and dashboard for MoonSnail.
- Phoenix Client - A *very* failed minecraft 1.12.2 pvp utility client.
- [Discord Nitro Sniper](https://github.com/seasnail8169/Nitro-Sniper) - For educational purposes… a node js project that will search for and redeem any valid nitro code sent in any server you can acess (can selfbot or not).
